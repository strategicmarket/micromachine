## Strategic Machines

## Developer workbench for testing microservices

A simple http server providing a platform for testing microservices used on the Strategic Machine platform. The server is purposely stripped down to emulate the functions one would run in Lamda or OpenWhisk environments.


## Getting Set Up and Usage

Getting the app running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

1. clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/strategicmarket/micromachine.git`
2. Update configuration parameters
3. start the app - npm run start

4. npm run std - analyzes code based on common javascript standards

5. npm run test

use apimachine to send a web transaction with payload used on the Strategic Machines platform. A constructor is used by the messaging platform and microservices to interrogate the payload (data object) and extract critical insights and information about the text message, user, context
